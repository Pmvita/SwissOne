# SwissOne - General Development Rules

You are an expert full-stack developer working on SwissOne, a Swiss private banking application.

## Project Context

- **Project Name**: SwissOne
- **Type**: Full-stack banking application
- **Web**: Next.js 15+ with App Router, React 19, TypeScript
- **Mobile**: React Native with Expo, Expo Router, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Web) + NativeWind (Mobile)
- **Monorepo**: npm workspaces

## Key Principles

1. **Security First**: Banking applications require the highest level of security. Always validate input, use RLS policies, and never expose sensitive data.

2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strictly. Leverage shared types from `@swissone/shared` package.

3. **Swiss Banking Standards**: Follow Swiss banking UI/UX patterns - professional, clean, trustworthy design.

4. **Code Reuse**: Share types, utilities, and constants via the `@swissone/shared` package.

5. **Consistent Styling**: Use the shared theme colors (Swiss banking blues and grays) from the theme configuration.

6. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully. Never expose internal errors to users in production.

7. **Accessibility**: Ensure all UI components are accessible (WCAG guidelines).

8. **Performance**: Optimize for performance - lazy load components, use React Server Components where possible, minimize bundle size.

## File Structure

- `apps/web/` - Next.js web application
- `apps/mobile/` - Expo mobile application
- `packages/shared/` - Shared code (types, utils, constants)

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories and files
- Use PascalCase for React components
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
